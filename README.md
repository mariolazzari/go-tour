# A tour of Go

A [tour](https://go.dev/tour/list) of [Go](https://go.dev/) language.

## Welcome

[Welcome](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)

### Hello

```go
// hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

```sh 
go run hello.go
```

### Playground

Go [playground](https://go.dev/play/)

The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside a sandbox, then returns the output.

There are limitations to the programs that can be run in the playground:
- In the playground the time begins at 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC (determining the significance of this date is an exercise for the reader). This makes it easier to cache programs by giving them deterministic output.
There are also limits on execution time and on CPU and memory usage, and the program cannot access external network hosts.
- The playground uses the latest stable release of Go.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to the playground!")

	fmt.Println("The time is", time.Now())
}
```

## Basics

### Packages, variables and functions

Every Go program is made up of packages: programs start running in package main.
This program is using the packages with import paths *fmt* and *math/rand"*.

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path: the *math/rand* package comprises files that begin with the statement package *rand*.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

#### Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, *factored* import statement.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```

#### Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter: *Pi* is an exported name; *pi* does not start with a capital letter, so it is not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	// fmt.Println(math.pi) -> unexported
	fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

#### Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.
In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.
Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

For more about why types look the way they do, see the article on [Go's declaration syntax](https://go.dev/blog/declaration-syntax).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

#### Functions continued

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

#### Multiple results

A function can return any number of results.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

#### Named return values

Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.
These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.
A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
	x = sum * 4 / 9
	y = sum - x
	return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(split(17))
}
```

#### Variables

The *var* statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.
A var statement can be at package or function level.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
	var i int
	fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

#### Variables with initializers

A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.
If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

#### Short variable declarations

Inside a function, the *:=* short assignment statement can be used in place of a *var* declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2
	k := 3
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

#### Basic types

Go's basic types are
- bool
- string
- int  int8  int16  int32  int64
- uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr
- byte (alias for uint8)
- rune (alias for int32): represents a Unicode code point
- float32 
- float64
- complex64 
- complex128
- 
The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.

The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/cmplx"
)

var (
	ToBe   bool       = false
	MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
	z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

#### Zero values

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

The zero value is:
- 0 for numeric types,
- false for the boolean type, and
- "" (the empty string) for strings.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var b bool
	var s string
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
```

#### Type conversions

The expression T(v) converts the value v to the type T.
Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

#### Constants

Constants are declared like variables, but with the *const* keyword.
- can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
- cannot be declared using the := syntax.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const Pi = 3.14

func main() {
	const World = "世界"
	fmt.Println("Hello", World)
	fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

	const Truth = true
	fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

#### Numeric Constants

Numeric constants are high-precision values.
An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	// Create a huge number by shifting a 1 bit left 100 places.
	// In other words, the binary number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
	Big = 1 << 100
	// Shift it right again 99 places, so we end up with 1<<1, or 2.
	Small = Big >> 99
)

func needInt(x int) int { 
    return x*10 + 1 
}

func needFloat(x float64) float64 {
	return x * 0.1
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(needInt(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Big))
}
```

### Flow control statements (for, if, switch, defer)

#### For

Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.

The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:
- the init statement: executed before the first iteration
- the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
- the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.
The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 0
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum += i
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

#### For continued

The init and post statements are optional.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for ; sum < 1000; {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

#### For is Go's "while"

At that point you can drop the semicolons

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for sum < 1000 {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

#### Forever

If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed.

```go
package main

func main() {
	for {
	}
}
```

#### If

Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( ) but the braces { } are required.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func sqrt(x float64) string {
	if x < 0 {
		return sqrt(-x) + "i"
	}
	return fmt.Sprint(math.Sqrt(x))
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(sqrt(2), sqrt(-4))
}
```

#### If with a short statement

Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.
Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
	if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
		return v
	}
	return lim
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		pow(3, 2, 10),
		pow(3, 3, 20),
	)
}
```

#### If and else

Variables declared inside an if short statement are also available inside any of the else blocks.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
	if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
		return v
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
	}
	// can't use v here, though
	return lim
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		pow(3, 2, 10),
		pow(3, 3, 20),
	)
}
```

#### Exercise: Loops and Functions

let's implement a square root function: given a number x, we want to find the number z for which z² is most nearly x.

Computers typically compute the square root of x using a loop. Starting with some guess z, we can adjust z based on how close z² is to x, producing a better guess:

z -= (z*z - x) / (2*z)
Repeating this adjustment makes the guess better and better until we reach an answer that is as close to the actual square root as can be.

#### Switch

A *switch* statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of *if - else* statements. 
It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Go runs on ")
	switch os := runtime.GOOS; os {
	case "darwin":
		fmt.Println("macOS.")
	case "linux":
		fmt.Println("Linux.")
	default:
		// freebsd, openbsd,
		// plan9, windows...
		fmt.Printf("%s.\n", os)
	}
}
```

#### Switch evaluation order

Switch cases evaluate cases from top to bottom, stopping when a case succeeds.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("When's Saturday?")
	today := time.Now().Weekday()
	switch time.Saturday {
	case today + 0:
		fmt.Println("Today.")
	case today + 1:
		fmt.Println("Tomorrow.")
	case today + 2:
		fmt.Println("In two days.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Too far away.")
	}
}
```

#### Switch with no condition

Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.
This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	t := time.Now()
	switch {
	case t.Hour() < 12:
		fmt.Println("Good morning!")
	case t.Hour() < 17:
		fmt.Println("Good afternoon.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Good evening.")
	}
}
```

#### Defer

A *defer* statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("world")

	fmt.Println("hello")
}
```

#### Stacking defers

Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("counting")

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		defer fmt.Println(i)
	}

	fmt.Println("done")
}
```

### Structs, slices and maps

#### Pointers

A pointer holds the memory address of a value.
The type *T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.
